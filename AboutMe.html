                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I am Nicholas Fiebig, a computer science student at UW-Whitewater interested in becoming a software engineer. Once I started taking Computer Science courses in High School, I knew
                    this was the career path I wanted to take. Learning to solve complex problems and develop my technical skills grew my passion for programming and interest in the Computer Science field.
                    I joined the Wisconsin National Guard in December 2020 to become a Cyber Security Officer. The cyber branch has developed a different understanding of the technical field, and the army has allowed me to grow as a leader. 
                    A fun fact about me is that I was born on a military base in England, however, I grew up in Milton, Wisconsin. Please feel free to email me as I'd love the opportunity to develop these skills in a professional setting. Thank you!
